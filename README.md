# Coursel
### [http://heidid.github.io/coursel](http://heidid.github.io/coursel)
An application for students to plan what courses they want to take throughout high school. It is currently tailored specifically for Homestead High School, 2014.

### Features
- Automatically counts credits
- Easy drag-and-drop interface

### Todo
Add the functionality to:
- export to a Google Spreadsheet or Excel document
- clear a row, column, or whole table
- save course plans with/without an account
- view other students' course plans
- automatically find similar course plans of other students
- implement scheduling exceptions, for example, PE Sport only counts for 5 credits instead of 10.
